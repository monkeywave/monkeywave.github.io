**Hi there!** 👋  
I'm a mobile security researcher passionate about automating and optimizing reverse engineering. My work focuses on two key areas: **network decryption** and **mobile malware analysis**, with the goal of simplifying security analysis to lower the barriers for beginners and help make the world a safer and better place.  
  

🔭 **What I’m currently working on:**  
- [friTap](https://github.com/fkie-cad/friTap) — A powerful tool to facilitate network decryption for (mobile) apps.

  
🌱 I’m constantly learning and exploring new ways to simplify TLS and end-to-end (E2E) decryption.  
⚙️ My mission is to make security analysis more accessible, reduce the barriers to entry, and contribute to a safer, more secure world.
👯 I’m always open to collaborating on cool new ideas related to mobile app analysis!  

If you’d like to support my work, help me develop more tools, and contribute to a more transparent security landscape, feel free to [**buy me a coffee**](https://buymeacoffee.com/monkeywave) — every bit fuels the mission! ☕✨
