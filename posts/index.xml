By automating key extraction and decrypting traffic at runtime, friTap simplifies complex workflows, making it especially valuable for malware analysis and the investigation of data privacy practices in mobile and desktop applications. For more technical background, see this in-depth post or explore the source code directly on GitHub.
A core feature of friTap is its ability to extract TLS session keys across various platforms and TLS implementations, allowing seamless integration into traffic analysis pipelines using tools like Wireshark, Zeek and others.</description></item></channel></rss>
